ELF Miner
=========

This is an approximate implementation of the ELF Miner framework as described in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-011-0393-5). The difference being that this model aims to classify a given ELF as Malware or Benign and not five the type of Malware as described in the paper. This is because of the limitations of the dataset used.
